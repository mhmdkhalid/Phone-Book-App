# Phone Book Application in C++

## Overview
This Phone Book Application allows users to manage a collection of contact entries, including names and phone numbers. It provides functionalities to add, display, search, and update entries, as well as to copy the phone book to a new instance. The program demonstrates object-oriented programming concepts, dynamic memory management, and basic input/output handling.

## Features
- **Add Entry**: Add a new contact with a name and phone number, ensuring the phone number is valid (11 digits).
- **Display All Contacts**: Print all contact entries in the phone book.
- **Search by Name**: Search for contact(s) by name, displaying matching results.
- **Search by Phone**: Find a contact's name using their phone number.
- **Find by Index**: Display contact details at a specified index.
- **Update Contact**: Update the name or phone number of a contact at a specified index.
- **Copy Phone Book**: Create a copy of the current phone book and display the entries in the new instance.
